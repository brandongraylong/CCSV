# Rust CSV - WIP
Simple CSV library in Rust.

## About
Simple implementation that I'm basing off of [RFC4180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180).
This is a hobby project, mostly for learning how to work with FFI bindings. See [Rust CSV FFI](https://github.com/brandongraylong/rust-csv-ffi).

## Limitations
Currently just parsing strings for cells in non-header rows.

## TODO
- Unit tests
- Typecasting?
